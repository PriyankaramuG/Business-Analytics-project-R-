Problem Definition
Onboarding new customers to commit to term deposits has never been so important to the 
Portuguese banking industry. “The Portuguese banking system was badly shaken by the 
euro-zone crisis, and in 2012 undercapitalized banks were forced to accept bailout funds 
that originated with the International Monetary Fund and the EU.”1 Compounded by the 
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic, banks must ensure they have adequate liquidity to 
survive periods of market stress. According to an infographic on the website 
for the Associação Portuguesa de Bancos. “Customer deposits have increased in the 
pandemic context, continuing to be the sector’s main funding source.”2 
Banks must find effective ways to market their savings products, one of the key channels 
they can do this is telemarketing. However, with developments in targeted online 
marketing, telemarketing must keep up with the times. We aim to depart upon a business 
analytics project to assess the data from the direct marketing campaigns for an unnamed 
Portuguese banking institution. (From the UCI Machine Learning 
Repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing) Being able to 
‘score’ potential customers that by their chance of conversion, we will allow the bank’s sales 
teams to work on the best leads. Concurrently, assessing the top features of a successfully 
onboarded client we will also gain insight that can be used for the bank’s other campaigns 
and strategies.
